ðŸŒ¸ Spring Boot User Management Demo ðŸŒ¸
Welcome to the Spring Boot User Management Demo! This project is a delightful introduction to Spring Boot, showcasing the magic of Dependency Injection, Layered Architecture, and In-Memory Data Storage. Whether you're a budding developer or a seasoned coder, this demo will help you grasp the fundamentals while keeping things fun and engaging.

ðŸš€ Technologies Used
Java 17

Spring Boot (Because who likes boilerplate code? âœ¨)

JUnit 5 (For testing like a pro ðŸ§ª)

Gradle (For smooth dependency management ðŸ“¦)
ðŸŽ¯ Key Features
âœ¨ Layered Architecture â€“ Clean separation of concerns with Model, Repository, and Service layers.
âœ¨ Dependency Injection â€“ Let Spring handle the heavy lifting with @Autowired.
âœ¨ In-Memory Storage â€“ A "fake" database (no SQL, no problem!).
âœ¨ Unit Testing â€“ Because untested code is like a sandwich without filling. ðŸ¥ª
ðŸ“œ Code Standards
âœ” Java Best Practices â€“ CamelCase, PascalCase, and encapsulation galore!
âœ” Spring Boot Annotations â€“ @SpringBootApplication, @Autowired, and more.
âœ” Testing â€“ JUnit 5 tests for every service method.
âœ” Git Commit Standards â€“ Because clean commits = happy teammates.
